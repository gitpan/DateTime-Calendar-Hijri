DateTime-Calendar-Hijri
=======================

This module parses Islamic dates in the Hijri calendar. This calendar
starts at the Hijrah, the flight of Mohammed to Medina in the year 622
Gregorian.

Compared to some other DateTime calendar modules,
DateTime::Calendar::Hijri has only very limited functionality. This is
because I am not very familiar with this calendar. The module is a thin
wrapper around the Date::Hijri module by Alex Pleiner.

If you are familiar with the Hijri calendar, and if you want to take
over the maintainership of this module, please mail me at the address
included in the module documentation, or contact the datetime@perl.org
mailing list.
